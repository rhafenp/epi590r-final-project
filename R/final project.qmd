## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
raw_data <- read_csv(here :: here("data", "cheeses.csv"))
cheese <- raw_data |>
	select(cheese, milk, country, type, fat_content, vegetarian)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
tbl_summary(
	cheese,
	by = type,
	include = c(milk, country, fat_content, vegetarian))
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
